      <description>Trying to implement a recursive algorithm in assembly is both a challenging puzzle and very informative exercise to demonstrate some important properties of recursion and function calls in general.
Recursion Recursion is super important for writing clean and concise solutions to a whole subset of programming tasks. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say it&amp;rsquo;s without its drawbacks.
Some problems can be solved both iteratively and recursively. Due to the way a computer works—specifically the stack—the recursive solution often produces less efficient code.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows how devastating it can be to lose all your personal and configuration files to hardware failure. As such, most users have some way to keep their files safe. Many choose to use some sort of dotfile management system. This is is a great choice as it allows for version control and branches for multiple machines. However, dotfiles are not the only thing you want to preserve. Furthermore, when it comes to backups, more redundancy is never a bad thing.</description>
